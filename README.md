Hi, I'm Lucian Rosu, I'm a junior front-end developer based in Exeter, UK. I developed my skills at Scrimba(an 84-hour course with hundreds of challenges), I am a creative and energetic developer who thrives in a collaborative environment.

### My Goal: 

I am exploring opportunities to develop my programming skills. 
I am now looking for a Junior or Associate position in a mission-driven company to further develop my skills while contributing to a production-level code base.
