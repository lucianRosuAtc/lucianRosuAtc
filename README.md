Hi, I'm Lucian Rosu, a Front-End Developer based out of Exeter, UK. I am a creative and energetic developer who thrives in a collaborative environment. I love a challenge and approach problems with a results-driven mindset to create engaging user experiences. If anyone is hiring, has contacts, or knows of any positions available, please let me know!

### My Goal: 

I am exploring opportunities to develop my programming skills. 
I am now looking for a Junior or Associate position in a mission-driven company to further develop my skills while contributing to a production-level code base.
