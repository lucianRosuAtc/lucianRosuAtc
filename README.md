I'm Lucian Rosu, I'm a Junior Front-End Developer based in Exeter, UK. I developed my skills at Scrimba and the University of Leeds, I am a creative and energetic developer who thrives in a collaborative environment. I'm the type of person who likes to go the extra mile.

### My Story: 

I've always wanted to code and not too long ago I decided to learn how to do it. Why Front-End? I love a challenge and approach problems with a results-driven mindset to create engaging user experiences.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React are the technologies that I currently use to make websites. I have learned these skills at Scrimba and the University of Leeds. You can check my Front-End projects down below and you can also refer to my GitHub Repositories to see the source code.
